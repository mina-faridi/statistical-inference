a)

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is the nonparametric test equivalent to the dependent t-test. As the Wilcoxon signed-rank test does not assume normality in the data, it can be used when this assumption has been violated and the use of the dependent t-test is inappropriate. The Wilcoxon test can be a good alternative to the t-test when population means are not of interest.

```{r}
table <- matrix(nrow=2, ncol=8, byrow=TRUE)

rownames(table) <- c( 'Group 1', 'Group 2')

table[1,] = c(19.0, 14.4, 18.2, 15.6, 14.5, 11.2, 13.9, 11.6)
table[2,] = c(12.1, 19.1, 11.6, 21.0, 16.7, 10.1, 18.3, 20.5)

wilcox.test(table[1, ], table[2, ],exact = FALSE)

```

null hypothesis can't be rejected since p-value is greater than alpha

group1 rank = 13, 7, 11, 9, 8, 2, 6, 3.5, 59.5

group 2 rank = 5, 14, 3.5, 16, 10, 1, 12, 15, 76.5

59.5 and 76.5 are between the range [49,87] where we can't reject null hypothesis.

b)

Siegel-Tukey test is a non-parametric test. The null hypothesis is that the variability of x is equal between two groups. A rejection of the null hypothesis indicates that variability differs between the two groups. SiegelTukeyRank returns the ranks, calculated after Siegel Tukey logic.

The Wilcoxon test statistic "W" is simply the smaller of the rank totals. The SMALLER it is (taking into account how many participants you have) then the less likely it is to have occurred by chance.

W_group1 = 4 + 13/2 + 12 + 13 + 16 + 15 + 11 + 7

= 84.5

W_group2 = 1 + 13/2 + 9 + 14 + 10 + 6 + 3 + 2

= 51.5

U_group1 = W_group1  - 8\*9/2=48.5

U_group2 = W_group2 - 8\*9/2=15.5

so we consider the range [49,87] from the table.

so p-value = pr[X\<15.5] = 0.0249.

so we can't reject the null hypothesis.
