a) chi_sqr = ((38-50)\^2)/50+((64 - 50)\^2)/50=6.8

```{r}
p_value = pchisq(6.8, 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

If a \> 0.0091 the null hypothesis is rejected

b) A binomial distribution can be thought of as simply the probability of a SUCCESS or FAILURE outcome in an experiment or survey that is repeated multiple times. The mean is p and standard deviation is (p(1-p)/n)\^2. when p=0.5 or for large n it is symmetrical.

c) X\^2 = 6.8

6.63\<6.68

p-value\<q.99

p-value\<0.01

d)

answer is always \>0 and has a factor (x-n/2)\^2.
