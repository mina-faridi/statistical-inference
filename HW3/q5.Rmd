a)
The Mann-Whitney U Test is a statistical test used to determine if 2 groups are significantly different from each other on your variable of interest. The variable of interest should be continuous and 2 groups should have similar values on variable of interest. 2 groups should be independent (not related to each other) and you should have enough data (more than 5 values in each group, though it also depends on how big the difference is between groups).

b)

if we sort the values and get the mean of reppetitous values:

ce_iq_rank = 9, 13.5, 11, 11, 7, 15, 13.5, 11, 5, 8, 104

ee_iq_rank = 17, 16, 4, 1, 20, 19, 6, 3, 2, 18, 106

c)

U_ce_iq = 10\*10+10\*5.5-104 = 51

U_ee_iq = 10\*10+10\*0.5-106 = 49

U = min(U_ce_iq , U_ee_iq ) = 49

by checking the chart for n1 and n2 = 10 we find the value 23 for U_critical.

which U_state is greater than U_critical so we can't reject null hypothesis.

The groups are similar.

by p-value:

Mean = 10\*10 / 2=50

std_err = ((100 + 21)/12)\^2=3.17

z = (U - Mean)/std_err = -0.314

-\> p-value -\> 0.7535

So null hypothesis can't be rejected.

d)

p-value is:

```{r}
2*pnorm(q=-0.314)
```

d)

The p-value is a number, calculated from a statistical test, that describes how likely we are to have found a particular set of observations if the null hypothesis were true.

P-values are used in hypothesis testing to help decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the more likely we are to reject the null hypothesis.
