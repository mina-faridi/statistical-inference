a)  

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is the nonparametric test equivalent to the dependent t-test. As the Wilcoxon signed-rank test does not assume normality in the data, it can be used when this assumption has been violated and the use of the dependent t-test is inappropriate. The Wilcoxon test can be a good alternative to the t-test when population means are not of interest; for example, when one wishes to test whether a population's median is nonzero, or whether there is a better than 50% chance that a sample from one population is greater than a sample from another population. It is used to compare two sets of scores that come from the same participants. This can occur when we wish to investigate any change in scores from one time point to another, or when individuals are subjected to more than one condition.

The Wilcoxon test statistic "W" is simply the smaller of the rank totals. The SMALLER it is (taking into account how many participants you have) then the less likely it is to have occurred by chance.

T_negative = 1.5 + 6 = 7.5

T_positive = 1.5 + 3.5 + 3.5 + 5 = 13.5

W = min(T_negative,T_positive) = 7.5

There are 12 total samples,

b)  

```{r}
table <- matrix(nrow=2, ncol=6, byrow=TRUE)
table[1,] <- c(60, 56, 80, 73, 14, 32)
table[2,] <- c(58, 58, 83, 67, 17, 36)

wilcox.test(table[1, ], table[2, ], paired = TRUE)
```

It can be seen that the hypothesis is rejected.
